respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).\r\n                    The outbreak was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. As of 14 August 2020, \r\n                    more than 21 million cases of COVID‑19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, \r\n                    resulting in more than 761,000 deaths; more than 13 million people have recovered.\r\n                </p>,\r\n                <ul> {/*DWTP Healthy Practises*/}\r\n                    <li>Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for <bold>at least</bold>20 seconds.</li>\r\n                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed/dirty hands.</li>\r\n                    <li>Practice good respiratory etiquette (covering coughs and sneezes).</li>\r\n                    <li>Avoid close contact wwith people who are sick.</li>\r\n                    <li>Stay home if sick.</li>\r\n                </ul>,\r\n                <p> {/*DWTP Socialize*/}\r\n                    A significant distinction to make under these quarantine restrictions\r\n                     is the differenec between social and physical distance. Even though \r\n                     we are forced to be physically seperated from one another, it doesn't \r\n                     mean we have to lose our sense of connection.

On the other hand, your daily routines, such as your meals and activities, impact your \r\n                    quality of sleep.

Humans are social beings and socializing is considered \r\n                    to be a basic need. Try to reach out to those you have not talked in years by meeting up, chatting \r\n                    on the phone, or even play online games together. However, most importantly, understand that you are \r\n                    not alone and you have a community who is there to help you out.

As you \r\n                    grow up, you may find yourself doing fewer sports or activities that keep your body moving. It is \r\n                    crucial that you maintain a routine to take some time doing sports such as jogging, swimming, and even \r\n                    yoga can help. Otherwise, your body would feel stiff and have a weaker immune system that can lead to \r\n                    worse symptoms.\r\n                </p>,\r\n                <p> {/*HH Mind-setting*/}\r\n                    Life is a roller coaster and everyone knows that things will always go the other way we intended. You \r\n                    are not alone! The best way to help yourself with mistakes is to have a growth mindset in which you \r\n                    learn from your mistakes and let go of the little things. Do not regret the choices you made, but take \r\n                    them as lessons for future events. \r\n                </p>\r\n                ]\r\n            ],\r\n            open: [false, false, false, false]\r\n        }\r\n        this.handleOpen = this.handleOpen.bind(this);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    handleOpen(index) {\r\n        let newOpenState = [...this.state.open];\r\n        newOpenState[index] = !this.state.open[index];\r\n        this.setState({open: newOpenState}, () => console.log(this.state.open));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        const {classes} = this.props;\r\n        const {question, topic, answers, open} = this.state;\r\n        return(\r\n            <div className={classes.border}>\r\n                <h2 className={classes.title}>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\r\n                <List>\r\n                    {this.state.questionText.map((question, i) => (\r\n                        <Question questionText={question} topicText={topic[i]} answersText={answers[i]} open={open} handleOpen={this.handleOpen} index={i}/>\r\n                    ))}\r\n                </List>\r\n            </div> \r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport default withStyles(styles)(FAQ);\r\n\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
