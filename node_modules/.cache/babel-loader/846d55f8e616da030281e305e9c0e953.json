All people have acute stress at one time or another.<br></br>\r\n\r\n                        Chronic stress - Chronic stress - This is stress that lasts for a longer period of time. You may \r\n                        have chronic stress if you have money problems, an unhappy marriage, or trouble \r\n                        at work. Any type of stress that goes on for weeks or months is chronic stress. \r\n                        You can become so used to chronic stress that you don't realize it is a problem. \r\n                        If you don't find ways to manage stress, it may lead to health problems.<br></br>\r\n                        Seek help if:\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>You have feelings of panic, such as dizziness, rapid breathing, or a racing heartbeat.</li>\r\n                        <li>You are unable to work or function at home or at your job.</li>\r\n                        <li>You have fears that you cannot control.</li>\r\n                        <li>You are having memories of a traumatic event.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </div>,\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <p> {/*UE About Anger*/}\r\n                    Anger is an emotion characterized by antagonism toward someone or something you feel has deliberately done \r\n                    you wrong. Anger can be a good thing. It can give you a way to express negative feelings, for example, or \r\n                    motivate you to find solutions to problems. But excessive anger can cause problems. Increased blood pressure \r\n                    and other physical changes associated with anger make it difficult to think straight and harm your physical \r\n                    and mental health.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Controlling anger:\r\n                    The goal of anger management is to reduce both your emotional feelings and the physiological arousal that \r\n                    anger causes. You can't get rid of, or avoid, the things or the people that enrage you, nor can you change \r\n                    them, but you can learn to control your reactions. If you find yourself acting in ways that seem out of control \r\n                    and frightening, you might need help finding better ways to deal with this emotion.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>,\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional\r\n                    highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong>\r\n                             \r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Bipolar I disorder.

The first step is to assist \r\n                        patients with regaining weight to a healthy level. For patients with binge eating disorder it is important to help them \r\n                        interrupt and stop binges.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>However, restoring a person to normal weight or temporarily ending the binge-purge cycle does not address the underlying \r\n                    emotional problems that cause or are made worse by the abnormal eating behavior. Psychotherapy helps individuals with eating \r\n                    disorders to understand the thoughts, emotions and behaviors that trigger these disorders. In addition, some medications have \r\n                    also proven to be effective in the treatment process.\r\n                    </p>       \r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Because of the serious physical problems caused by these illnesses, it is important that any treatment plan for a person with \r\n                        anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder include general medical care, nutritional management and nutritional \r\n                        counseling. These measures begin to rebuild physical well-being and healthy eating practices.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                </div>\r\n                ], \r\n                [\r\n                <p> {/*DWTP What is the COVID-19 Pandemic?*/}\r\n                    The COVID‑19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, \r\n                    is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), \r\n                    caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).\r\n                    The outbreak was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
