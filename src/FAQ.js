                    A mix of genetic, biological, 
                    psycho-social and environmental factors can induce mental illness. 
                    Mental illness can run in the family since genetics plays a role 
                    in the development of mental health disorder. 
                    If a relative struggled with a disorder, 
                    then that personâ€™s genes may adapt genetic codes that 
                    make them experience mental health disorder such as depression and anxiety.

                    anxiety and sleep disturbances. If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, consider to calling

                    Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension that comes from any event or thought that makes
                    you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous.<br></br>
                    There are two main types of stress:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Acute stress</li>
                        <li>Chronic stress</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Acute stress - This is short-term stress that goes away quickly. 
                        Acute stress helps you manage dangerous situations. It also occurs when you do 
                        something new or exciting. All people have acute stress at one time or another.<br></br>

                        Chronic stress - Chronic stress - This is stress that lasts for a longer period of time. You may 
                        have chronic stress if you have money problems, an unhappy marriage, or trouble 
                        at work. Any type of stress that goes on for weeks or months is chronic stress. 
                        You can become so used to chronic stress that you don't realize it is a problem. 
                        If you don't find ways to manage stress, it may lead to health problems.<br></br>

                    Anger is an emotion characterized by antagonism toward someone or something you feel has deliberately done 
                    you wrong. Anger can be a good thing. It can give you a way to express negative feelings, for example, or 
                    motivate you to find solutions to problems. But excessive anger can cause problems. Increased blood pressure 
                    and other physical changes associated with anger make it difficult to think straight and harm your physical 
                    and mental health.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Controlling anger:
                    The goal of anger management is to reduce both your emotional feelings and the physiological arousal that 
                    anger causes. You can't get rid of, or avoid, the things or the people that enrage you, nor can you change 
                    them, but you can learn to control your reactions. If you find yourself acting in ways that seem out of control 
                    and frightening, you might need help finding better ways to deal with this emotion.

                    Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional
                    highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).

                        <li>Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one 
                        hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode.</li>

                        â€” of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major 
                        depression).</li>
                        <li>Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain

                    Eating disorders are illnesses in which the people experience severe disturbances in their eating behaviors and related 
                    thoughts and emotions. People with eating disorders typically become preoccupied with food and their body weight.<br></br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Treatment:</strong> <br></br>
                        Eating disorders clearly illustrate the close links between emotional and physical health. The first step is to assist 
                        patients with regaining weight to a healthy level. For patients with binge eating disorder it is important to help them 
                        interrupt and stop binges.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, restoring a person to normal weight or temporarily ending the binge-purge cycle does not address the underlying 
                    emotional problems that cause or are made worse by the abnormal eating behavior. Psychotherapy helps individuals with eating 
                    disorders to understand the thoughts, emotions and behaviors that trigger these disorders. In addition, some medications have 
                    also proven to be effective in the treatment process.
                    </p>       
                    <p>
                        Because of the serious physical problems caused by these illnesses, it is important that any treatment plan for a person with 
                        anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder include general medical care, nutritional management and nutritional 
                        counseling. These measures begin to rebuild physical well-being and healthy eating practices.

                    Another factor that can affect both your mental and physical health is the lack of exercise. As you 
                    grow up, you may find yourself doing fewer sports or activities that keep your body moving. It is 
                    crucial that you maintain a routine to take some time doing sports such as jogging, swimming, and even 
                    yoga can help. Otherwise, your body would feel stiff and have a weaker immune system that can lead to 
                    worse symptoms.

                    Life is a roller coaster and everyone knows that things will always go the other way we intended. You 
                    are not alone! The best way to help yourself with mistakes is to have a growth mindset in which you 
                    learn from your mistakes and let go of the little things. Do not regret the choices you made, but take 
                    them as lessons for future events.
